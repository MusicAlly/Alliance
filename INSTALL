Alliance is a Django app, which is different from a Django project.

If you put Alliance in a directory which isn't in your project directory, you
need to show your project where to find it, which means that it must be in
Python's path. You have two options: you can set the environment variable
PYTHONPATH to include the toplevel Alliance directory, whereever it is that
you've installed it, or you can insert the following into the top of the
project's settings.py:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/Alliance')

Now, python (and therefore your project) know where Alliance is. However, you
need to tell your project that you are in fact using Alliance. In your
project's settings.py, make sure that alliance (note the lower-case) is
included in INSTALLED_APPS.

You also need to edit urls.py so that users can access the views. For example,
if you want http://www.yoursite.com/alliance to go to the front page, you would
add

url(r'^alliance/', include('alliance.urls'))

to your urlpatterns.
